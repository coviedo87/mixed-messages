# Mix messages
mixed messages generator

## Description
For this project, I built a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. To make the program truly random, the message that it outputs is made up of  three different pieces of data.

In this repo, you will find three branches
1. the main branch contains this readme file. This branch will be used to merge the final submission
2. The master branch contains a script that generates predefined messages
3. The feature-branch contains a script that generates a random memento message as described in the Description

### HTML
Open the console and then click on the button to generate a message. The message will be logged in the console. See example below

### Challenge
Clone this repo and update the button functionality so it shows the message on the web page. Add any styling you like!
